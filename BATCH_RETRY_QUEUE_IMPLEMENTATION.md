# Batched Retry Queue Implementation

## Overview

The SerpBear application has implemented an optimized batched retry queue removal system in `utils/refresh.ts` to address performance issues when handling multiple skipped keywords. This implementation reduces I/O operations from N to 2 (1 read, 1 write) for N skipped keywords.

## Problem Statement

Previously, when keywords needed to be removed from the retry queue, the application would perform file I/O operations for each individual keyword ID. This approach was inefficient and caused performance issues with high I/O load when processing many skipped keywords.

## Current Implementation

### Key Components

1. **Imports** (Line 4 in `utils/refresh.ts`):
   ```typescript
   import { readFile, writeFile } from 'fs/promises';
   ```

2. **Database Operations** (Lines 44-47):
   ```typescript
   await Keyword.update(
      { updating: false },
      { where: { ID: { [Op.in]: skippedIds } } },
   );
   ```

3. **Batched File Operations** (Lines 49-66):
   ```typescript
   const idsToRemove = new Set(skippedIds);
   if (idsToRemove.size > 0) {
     const filePath = `${process.cwd()}/data/failed_queue.json`;
     try {
       const currentQueueRaw = await readFile(filePath, { encoding: 'utf-8' });
       let currentQueue: number[] = JSON.parse(currentQueueRaw);
       const initialLength = currentQueue.length;
       currentQueue = currentQueue.filter((item) => !idsToRemove.has(item));

       if (currentQueue.length < initialLength) {
         await writeFile(filePath, JSON.stringify(currentQueue), { encoding: 'utf-8' });
       }
     } catch (error: any) {
       if (error.code !== 'ENOENT') {
         console.log('[ERROR] Failed to update retry queue:', error);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Set-based filtering**: Uses `Set` for O(1) lookup performance when filtering IDs
2. **Single read operation**: Reads the entire queue file once
3. **Conditional write**: Only writes back to file if changes were actually made
4. **Batch database updates**: Uses `Op.in` for efficient database operations

### Error Handling

- **ENOENT handling**: Gracefully handles missing queue files without logging errors
- **Other errors**: Logs actual errors for debugging purposes
- **Robust error recovery**: Continues operation even if file operations fail

## Test Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage in `__tests__/utils/refresh.test.ts`:

1. **Batched operations test**: Verifies the batched file operations work correctly
2. **Empty keywords handling**: Ensures no file operations when no keywords are skipped
3. **Missing file handling**: Tests graceful handling of missing queue files
4. **Error handling**: Tests appropriate error logging for non-ENOENT errors
5. **No-change optimization**: Verifies writeFile is skipped when queue is unchanged

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Reduces I/O operations from N to 2 for N skipped keywords
2. **Reliability**: Robust error handling prevents failures from propagating
3. **Efficiency**: Only performs write operations when necessary
4. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-tested code with comprehensive coverage
