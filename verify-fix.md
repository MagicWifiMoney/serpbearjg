# Verification Script for Search Console Fix

This script demonstrates the fix for the search console statistics issue in daily emails.

## Problem
The original cron job was calling `fetchDomainSCData(domain)` without proper API credentials, causing search console data fetching to silently fail.

## Solution
The fixed code now:
1. Calls `getSearchConsoleApiInfo(domain)` to get proper API credentials for each domain
2. Passes these credentials to `fetchDomainSCData(domain, scDomainAPI)`
3. Includes proper error handling and logging
4. Skips domains without search console integration gracefully

## Expected Behavior
- Domains with search console credentials: Data fetched and saved successfully
- Domains without credentials: Skipped with appropriate logging
- Individual domain errors: Handled gracefully without affecting other domains

The fix ensures fresh search console data is available for daily email notifications.
